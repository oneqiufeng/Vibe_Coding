# Concept and Origin

Vibe Coding represents a paradigm shift in software development and programming education. Introduced by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, this revolutionary approach immerses programmers in a creative and interactive experience where they:

- Guide AI-generated code rather than manually writing every line
- Test and optimize AI-generated outputs
- Focus on creative direction instead of syntax memorization
- Transform programming into an interactive dialogue with AI systems

This methodology emerged from the convergence of advanced large language models (LLMs) and human creativity, fundamentally redefining the developer's role in the coding process.
