# How It Works

## Iterative Development Process

1. **Description Phase**  
   Users articulate desired functionality using natural language

2. **Generation Phase**  
   AI models translate descriptions into executable code

3. **Testing & Optimization**  
   Users validate outputs and provide feedback to AI  
   Adjustments made without deep coding knowledge

4. **Refinement Loop**  
   Continuous iteration until specifications are met  
   Progressive improvement through AI-human collaboration
